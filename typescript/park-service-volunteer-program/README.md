# Park Service Volunteer Appreciation Program (TypeScript)

## Overview
A TypeScript project that merges volunteer logs from multiple park locations,
verifies and aggregates volunteer hours, and produces a sorted leaderboard
of top contributors.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- TypeScript types and type inference
- Array transformations (`map`, `forEach`, `sort`)
- Data normalization across multiple sources
- Readable, functional-style logic

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world, imperfect data
- Model data safely using TypeScript
- Produce deterministic, testable outputs

## Future Improvements
- Refactor into an Angular service
- Add a UI layer for visualization
- Replace static data with API input
